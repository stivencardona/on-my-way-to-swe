## A simple divide problem

**Description:** Given two numbers `p` and `q` your task is realize a simple code that return the value of `p/q` and the residue `r`, just have one consideration you cannot use a `/` operator.

## Dot product

**Description:** Given two vectors in their sparse representation calculate the dot product between them. You can assume that the sparse representation for this case is a vector of pairs `(k, v)` (sorting by `k` value in `asc` order) when `k` represent the index in the original vector and `v` represent the value present in the `k-th` on the vector.

**Note:** A sparse representation of any vector is a compression technique use to avoid store repetitive data like many consecution of zeroes
